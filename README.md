# eb_mapping

## Authors: Cole Johnston & Timothy van Reeth

This is a code that demonstrates the influence of eclipse mapping on the
observed phase and amplitude of a stellar pulsation.

Currently, the code only works for **p mode** pulsations. Future work will extend
the code to include g modes that account for rotation via the Traditional
Approximation of Rotation (TAR).


This code is based on a code originally developed by Timothy van Reeth.
